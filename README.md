# Greenroom: Your Backend Factory for AI-Powered Applications

Greenroom is a boilerplate project designed to accelerate the development of AI-powered applications and robust data pipelines. It seamlessly integrates a powerful tech stack to empower you with:

## Rapid API Development
Effortlessly build RESTful endpoints for:
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Custom backend processes
- Database interactions (ChromaDB, Elasticsearch, Firestore)

## Data Ingestion
Streamline data collection via:
- Web scraping with Selenium
- Google Sheets integrations

## Data Management
- Powerful filtering and search with Elasticsearch
- Automated database maintenance (cron jobs)

## Deployment & Observability
- Docker-based deployment for consistency
- Robust logging and testing architecture

## Tech Stack
Greenroom leverages a cutting-edge stack to deliver a flexible and efficient development experience:
- **Python**: The foundation for our backend services.
- **FastAPI**: A high-performance framework for building APIs.
- **LangChain**: Simplifies working with language models and data sources.
- **Docker**: Containerization for seamless deployment.
- **ChromaDB, Elasticsearch, Firestore**: Choose the database that best suits your needs.
- **Selenium**: Web scraping capabilities.
- **Google Sheets API**: Integrate with spreadsheets for data input/output.
- **(Optional) Celery**: Task queue for background processes and scheduling.

## Key Features
- **Modular Structure**: Clearly organized modules for API endpoints, data pipelines, and database operations.
- **Example Implementations**: Get started quickly with code examples for RAG, web scraping, data filtering, etc.
- **Configuration**: Easily adjust settings for databases, logging, and scraping targets.
- **Testing Framework**: Included tests ensure the reliability of your application.
- **Scalability**: Designed to grow with your needs.
