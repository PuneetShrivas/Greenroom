I had the same issue, but accepted answer given here did not work for me. I tried few steps and was able to get around to push it finally.

Here are the steps worked for me:

Login to the docker.

docker login -u darlin

Tag your image build

my image name here is mylocalimage and by default it has tag latest
and my username is darlin as registered with docker cloud, and I created a public repository named dockerhub

so my personal repository becomes now darlin/dockerhub and I want to push my image with tag myfirstimagepush.

I tagged as below :

docker tag mylocalimage:latest darlin/dockerhub:myfirstimagepush
Pushed the image to my personal docker repository as below

docker push darlin/dockerhub:myfirstimagepush

And it was successfully pushed to my personal docker repo.
